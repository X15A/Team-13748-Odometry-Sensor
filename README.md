# Team-13748-Odometry-Sensor
PCB files and 3D models for team 13748's odometry pods. The pods are currently only configured for the GoBuilda strafer chassis, specifically a modified version which moves the drive motors out of the rails on either side of the robot. These pods are intended to be a much lower cost solution for teams that want to experiment with dead wheel odometry localization. Our team partnered with Causality Manufacturing to develop the inexpensive magnetic encoders used in these pods, which will be available for teams to purchase soon.
Teams can also have their own encoder PCB's produced using the attached GRBL files and off the shelf components, although SMD reflow soldering equipment is needed for this.

Parts Needed
Aside from the 3D printed components and encoder PCB, these pods will need a few additional parts. Additional parts needed are as follows.

3x 5x10x4mm ball bearings
1x 8x12x3.5mm flanged bearings
2x M3 threaded inserts
1x 2.5" 10-24 machine screw
