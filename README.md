# Team-13748-Odometry-Sensor
PCB files and 3D models for team 13748's odometry pods. These pods are intended to be a much lower cost solution for teams that want to experiment with dead wheel odometry localization. Our team partnered with Causality Manufacturing to develop the inexpensive magnetic encoders used in these pods, which will be available for teams to purchase soon.
Teams can also have their own encoder PCB's produced using the attached GRBL files and off the shelf components, although SMD reflow soldering equipment is needed for this.
