# Team-13748-Odometry-Sensor
PCB files and 3D models for team 13748's odometry pods. The pods are currently only configured for the GoBuilda strafer chassis, specifically a modified version which moves the drive motors out of the rails on either side of the robot. These pods are intended to be a much lower cost solution for teams that want to experiment with dead wheel odometry localization. 

Our team partnered with Causality Manufacturing to develop the magnetic encoder PCB's used in these pods, which will be available for teams to purchase soon. We expect for these encoders to be less than $10 each once production begins, allowing for the whole odometry pod to be built by teams for less than $30. These PCB's use MagnTek MT6816 sensors, which offer a fairly high resolution for a very low price, meaning that the performance of our encoders 
Teams can also have their own encoder PCB's produced using the attached GRBL files and off the shelf components, although SMD reflow soldering equipment is needed for this.

Parts Needed
Aside from the 3D printed components and encoder PCB, these pods will need a few additional parts. Additional parts needed are as follows.

3x 5x10x4mm ball bearings
1x 2" Andymark Omni-wheel (a version for smaller wheels is in development)
1x 8x12x3.5mm flanged bearings
2x M3 threaded inserts
1x 2.5" 10-24 machine screw
1x 6x2mm diametrically polarized (encoder) magnet


These odometry pods are designed to use an integrated 3D printed leaf spring to provide positive pressure into the ground. This decision was made to simplify construction, avoiding the need for any other components than the 3D printed housing pieces. This helps improve reliability while also lowering the cost by not requiring any additional parts.
